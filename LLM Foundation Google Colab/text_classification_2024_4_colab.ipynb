        "\n",
        "Generative models like PaLM 2 are powerful language models used for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. One of those is text classification, which involves assigning one or more categories to a given piece of text. Although text classification can be done using traditional NLP techniques, LLMs can perform classification by providing prompts (as opposed to domain-specific labeled data), which can accelerate the time it takes to build a text classification solution. Classification models based on LLMs can be further tuned with many examples via custom model training, but that is beyond the scope of this notebook.\n",

        "In this notebook, you will explore how to do text classification using prompts with the PaLM API. Learn more about classification prompts in the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/text/classification-prompts)."
